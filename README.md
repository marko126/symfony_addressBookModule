For the frontend part, I've worked with Bootstrap 4 and web pack to manage well the CSS and JS.

## How to install on your computer

`# Clone this git repo:`

`git clone https://github.com/sguiderk/symfony_addressBookModule.git`

`cd symfony_addressBookModule/`

`# install the depencies `

`composer update`

`# run the application `

`php bin\console server run `

Then it will open http://127.0.0.1:8000 and the application will be running.

## To Run Tests

`vendor\bin\simple-phpunit`
